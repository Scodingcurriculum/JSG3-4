//Variable is like a labelled jar where you can store different things, just like using a jar to keep marbles or candies. The label helps you find and use what's inside, and you can change what you put in the jar anytime, like swapping candies for marbles. In programming, variables work the same way, holding and organizing data for your computer programs.

//Variables Example
console.log("Variable Example")
var name = 'Sam'
console.log(name)

// Data Types
//Think of data types as different kinds of information. For example, numbers are like counting your marbles. Words are like naming your toys. Yes or no is like answering questions in a game. Data types help the computer know what kind of information it's dealing with, like knowing if it's a number, a word, or a yes/no answer.

console.log("\n")
//Types of Data Types
console.log("Types of datatypes")
console.log("String")
// Strings
var name = 'Sam'
var age = 34
var gpa = 4.0
var sentence = 'Hello, my name is ' + name + ' and I am ' + age + ' years old.'
console.log(sentence)

console.log("\n")
console.log("Numbers")
// Numbers
var age = 34
var gpa = 4.0
var sentence = 'Hello, my name is ' + name + ' and I am ' + age + ' years old.'
console.log(sentence)
