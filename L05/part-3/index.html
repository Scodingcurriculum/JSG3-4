<!-- External CSS involves writing CSS rules in a separate .css file and linking it to the HTML file using the <link> tag. 
<link> tag is used inside the <head> section of the HTML file to connect the styles.css file to index.html. The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the HTML file and the linked resource (in this case, it's a stylesheet), while the href attribute specifies the path to the external CSS file.
Example (Create a file named style.css): 
HTML File linking to the external CSS file: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>External CSS Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
    <p>This is an example of external CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>
