<!--  What's CSS? It's Like a Superhero Costume!

Imagine you have an amazing superhero costume that makes you look fantastic and different from everyone else. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is just like thatâ€”it helps web pages look awesome and unique! 

CSS is used to style web pages. It changes how things look on a website, like the colors, fonts, sizes, and layouts. It's like using colorful markers to make a beautiful drawing or using different costumes to look cool. -->

<!-- Inline CSS involves styling HTML elements directly within the HTML tags themselves. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Inline CSS Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 style="color: blue; font-size: 24px;">Welcome to my Website</h1>
    <p style="font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;">This is an example of inline CSS.</p>
</body>
</html>
