//JavaScript is like the chef of the internet. It follows recipes to make web pages interactive.

//Imagine you're ordering food on a restaurant's website. JavaScript is the waiter who takes your order and tells the kitchen what you want. When you click a button to add a pizza, JavaScript adds it to your order. When you decide to remove an item, JavaScript takes it away.

//In a nutshell, JavaScript helps websites do cool things, like showing your order in real-time, suggesting items you might like, and even playing games on your phone. It's the behind-the-scenes magic that makes the web a fun and useful place.

// This is a comment. It's like a note to yourself and is not part of the code.
// Let's print a simple message to the console.
console.log('Hello World!!')
console.log('My name is Ujjwal Sharma.')
console.log('This is my 1st javascript code.')
console.log('I love coding!')
//Printing stars
console.log("   *   ");
console.log("  ***  ");
console.log(" ***** ");
console.log("*******");
console.log("   |   ");
